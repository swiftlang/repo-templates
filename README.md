# üñºÔ∏è üìÑ Swift Repository Templates üñºÔ∏è üìÑ

Helpful file templates and guidance for repositories in github.com/swiftlang. Project maintainers should use this guidance for the root files of every repository. 

## üåê SwiftLang GitHub Organization (Org) Level 

There is an organizational level [.github](https://github.com/swiftlang/.github) folder that optimizes for consistency across all repositories. Read more information about GitHub Org Level Files [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)

- CONDUCT.md**
- SECURITY.md**
- CONTRIBUTING.md (links to [swift.org/contributing](swift.org/contributing))
  
** = special exception from the Core Team in order to opt-out

## üè† Repo Level 

The following files are required in each repo and are not set at Org level:
- LICENSE  
  If it's not Apache 2.0 with runtime exception, the Core Team will need to approve. 
- README.md
  
Special Note:
- CONTRIBUTING.md  
  We encourage repo owners to have a custom CONTRIBUTING.md file. Many repos have different review flows, environment set up instructions, testing, and related that may help contributors AND maintainers have a better experience.
- NOTICE or ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  
  A repository may need to use one of these two files to include license information and more for dependencies, vendored code, etc. Please work with the [Core Team](https://forums.swift.org/new-message?groupname=core-team) to figure out the best course of action here.
  
.github templates:
- codeowners
- pull request template
- issue template
