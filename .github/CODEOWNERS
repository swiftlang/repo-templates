# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
#
# File patterns are case-sensitive and follow most of the same rules used in
# .gitignore files. Start patterns that are meant to be relative to the root
# with a forward slash to prevent the matching from occurring at an arbitraty
# level. End patterns that are meant to match directories with a forward slash
# to make it visually apparent.
#
# Each file pattern should be followed by one or more GitHub usernames or team
# names using the standard @username or @swiftlang/team-name format. Please
# order these names lexicographically.
#
# Line order is important. The last matching pattern in this file takes
# precedence.

#
# Please list patterns by mirroring the repository's file hierarchy in
# case-sensitive lexicographic order. This approach follows a well-established
# and familiar order for navigation, helps to avoid inadvertent ownership
# overrides, and makes uncharted parts of the repository easier to pin down.

# The list is sorted by surname and formatted to allow easy grepping and
# beautification by scripts.  The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address
# (W), PGP key ID and fingerprint (P), description (D), and snail-mail address
# (S).
